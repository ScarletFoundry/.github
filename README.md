# Scarlet Foundry

**Forging Worlds, One Line at a Time.**

Welcome to Scarlet Foundry! We're building open-source creative tools to empower writers and make the writing process more engaging.

## About Us

Scarlet Foundry is the creative outlet for Jacqualine Patravee (Scar/Scarlet), an Indo-Thai developer and writer based in Bangkok. We're passionate about leveraging AI to assist writers.

Our mission is to democratize creativity by providing writers with free and accessible AI-powered tools that spark inspiration.

## What We're Building

We're focused on developing tools to help writers:

*   Brainstorm ideas
*   Overcome writer's block
*   Craft compelling narratives

Our primary project, **Veridia**, uses technologies like Python (for AI/ML), JavaScript/TypeScript (for the user interface), and potentially Go or Rust.

## Projects (Under Development)
